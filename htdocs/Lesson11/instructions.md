Attached is a compressed file with 3 files: courses.php, addcourse.php, and addcourse-submit.php. courses.php displays the courses from our it1150 databases -> courses table. Unzip these files to a Lab11 folder in your Apache web server directory. Then, complete the following:
Modify courses.php. There is a select element in the top right corner of the page. When you change the selection, it reloads the page. Modify the page, so it actually changes the order in which the courses are sorted using the value that is sent in a querystring value when the select is changed. Course id should be the default sort. Note; you canW simply check to see if there is a form post (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-check-form-submission-in-php/). Then change the SQL query to sort appropriately. You should also use the posted value to add a selected default value for the select element.
There is a page called addcourse-submit.php. addcourse.php posts values already. Modify addcourse-submit.php, so that it inserts the values posted from addcourse.php into the database. Output a confirmation as to whether the course was added. And, provide a way for the user to return to courses.php (a redirect, a button, a link, etc.).
When completed, submit a compressed (.zip) file with all 3 files: courses.php, addcourse.php, and addcourse-submit.php.
